# Chapter 2 - Linked Lists 

A linked list is a data structure that represents a sequence of nodes.

## Tips
 - <b>[The "Runner" Technique](src/main/java/ppongelupe/ctci/chapter2/tips/RunnerTechnique.java)</b>:  Iterate through the linked list with <b>two pointers simultaneously</b>, with one ahead of the other. The <i>"fast" node</i> might be ahead by a fixed
  amount, or it might be hopping multiple nodes for each one node that the
  <i>"slow" node</i> iterates through.
